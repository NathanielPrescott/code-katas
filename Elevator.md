Elevator

- An elevator responds to calls containing a source floor and direction
- An elevator delivers passengers to requested floors (each passenger can request different floors)
- An elevator doesn't respond immediately, consider options to simulate time
- Elevator calls are queued not necessarily FIFO
- There can be more than one elevator

- You may validate passenger floor requests
- You may implement current floor monitor
- You may implement direction arrows
- You may implement doors (opening and closing)
- You may implement Ding (sound for arrived elevator)

Bonus
-----
1. Display what is occuring with each elevator
2. Randomly generate passengers and destinations (If done after your display is create, sit back and enjoy the show)
