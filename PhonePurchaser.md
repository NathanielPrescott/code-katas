This kata got its inspiration from the practice exercise in the link above.

The goal of this program is for a customer to add multiple phones and accessories to their cart, which the application should then calculate the taxs with their purchase and display it to them.

- Give the customer multiple phones with different prices to choose from
- Give the customer multiple accessories with different prices to choose from
- The customer should have a max credit limit which they cannot exceed with their purchases
- When the customer is ready, add their cart together and then calculate the tax so that they can view the total (this should not exceed their credit limit)
